Features:
      - For loops
      - Conditionals
      - use of list and dictionary data structures
      - list filtering, lambda functions
      - opening/reading files
      - parsing files
      - saving outputs to a file
      - PyUnit testing

High Level Requirements:
	- The goal is to translate one line of english to morse or NATO phonetic alphabet
	- The program must open fonts.txt which contains METADATA and a one to one
		translation of an english character to more and NATO phonetic
	- The program must be able to read directions from the directives.txt file
		and write the translations into an outfile
		> The directives contain directions for which file to translate and to which language
			to translate.
	- Do NOT hard code the translations as the languages may be swapped around or
		new languages may be added to the fonts.txt file

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My Approach:
	- The fonts.txt file can be used to create associative arrays since there is a
		one to one 'translation' per character
	- I will create associative arrays and use them to build the translations and then
		save the translations into the appropriately named file
