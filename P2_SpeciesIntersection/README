Context:
	- A researcher friend of mine reached out to me asking if I could
		help him solve a problem.
	- He was testing samples for a the presence of a particular fungus
		and all his samples tested positive, which was very unusual
	- He had an idea that the reagents he was using possibly contained
		components from the fungus he was actually testing for in their
		standard formulation
	- He built a csv file, where each column represented a reagent
		he was using.
	- Each value in the column represented a species id for an
		organism whose parts were used for reagent.
	- He wanted help finding any elements that appeared across all
		columns/reagents.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
My approach:
	- Get the unique values across all the reagents
	- Check if any unique element appears across all columns/reagents
	- write out a file containing information on all species that
		appeared across all columns for easy reading.
